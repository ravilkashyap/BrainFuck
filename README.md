# BrainFuck
A simple BrainFuck interpreter in Python

**Brainfuck** (BF) is an incredibly popular esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. The language consists of what some might refer to as "pure" memory management, as all one does while programming in it is increment or decrement values, along with a single data pointer. It contains a grand total of 8 instructions, which only allow for basic looping, user input, and output. 
Here's a list of the instructions...

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| + | Increments the value at the data pointer |
| - | Decrements the value at the data pointer |
| > | Increment the data pointer's address |
| < | Decrements the data pointer's address |
| , | Get 1 character of user input and store it at the data pointer |
| . | Print the character at the data pointer |
| \[ | Jumps to next \] if the value at the data pointer is 0 |
| \] | Jumps back to the previous \[ if the value at the data pointer is not 0 |


#### Usage
Usage : **`python3 brainfuck.py FILE`** where file contains the BrainFuck code.
`--help` for more info

#### TODO's
Code simple programs until i get BrainFucked xD!
